I [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rap_no_Davinci&oldid=1306585149#Question_re:_AI have] always [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User%20talk:Rap%20no%20Davinci been] transparent about my use of LLM, when I stated that I can continue editing without it, I meant it. The article in question was not generated/created using LLM, it’s entirely my work and took me several days to draft the initial version. For "See page history [of the article]", it would actually help you see the amount of effort it took as a person to add few more sentences. From the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Holocaust%20survivors%20and%20descendants%20supporting%20Palestine&oldid=1332329558 initial version] to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Holocaust_survivors_and_descendants_supporting_Palestine&diff=prev&oldid=1332362953 final expansion], which included additional sentences and sources, I spent HOURS in reading, analyzing, and summarizing information in the sources. LLM would've taken few minutes, that's a human being behind their screen putting in real work. 

Does that mean I didn't make any mistakes? Absolutely not! Especially given the sensitive nature of the subject, but working on it is me [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Be_bold being brave] (and prepared for the pushback). There are likely phrases that could seem biased or could misrepresent the original sources, of course UNINTENTIONALLY. That's why [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Ownership_of_content we don't own articles] we create, and the community-driven work we do is what make this platform so special. Everyone is welcome to contribute to the article and make it better. (I am working on a section related to reception and criticism to address the tag of Unbalanced).

For [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Jewish_pro-Palestinian_activism#Merge the comment on merge], I, once again, didn't use LLM, and for the WP:SNG, (as I understand it), is for the article [[Holocaust survivors and descendants supporting Palestine]] as a very specific topic, very different and should not to be merged with [[Jewish pro-Palestinian activism]] just because they "overlap" in one singular general fact: both cover pro-Palestine activism by people of the Jewish faith.

Some of the criticism is legit (about 10% of the article needs improvement, mostly related to wording, I will address some of them) and I probably made some mistakes, please help make the article better. Thanks! <!-- Template:Unsigned --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Rap no Davinci|Rap no Davinci]] ([[User talk:Rap no Davinci#top|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rap no Davinci|contribs]]) 14:11, 18 January 2026 (UTC)</small>

* '''Reply:''' Thanks for extending my word limit, I'll do my best to address all points raised against me/the article.
For NicheSports' comment is what I referred to as "10% legit criticism", mostly related to wording.
In relation to sources and OR:
"A foundational principle for many Holocaust survivors ... " As the leading sentence, this is supported by the whole subsection of '"Never Again" applies to all people', as the next line is "They argue that the slogan "Never Again" must not be exclusive to Jews." and later "as descendants, we recognize that genocide makes no one safer." and so on.

The same with "The use of Holocaust memory in discussions of Israeli military...", followed by "Holocaust survivor Agnes Kory stated that she was "outraged and deeply insulted by the Holocaust being used as an excuse for Israel's relentless war against the Palestinian people," … and much later “victims of the Nazis who were outraged that Israel used their histories to justify assaults on Palestinians.”

for "(such as siege, mass displacement, and high civilian casualties)...", I added this as explanation for readers as these are already established "facts" supported by standalone articles on Wiki [[Siege of Gaza City]], [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip]]; for mass causalities [[Gaza genocide]], [[Casualties of the Gaza war]]. Is this a case of OR? From my pov, this is explanation [[WP:SYNNOT]]. Still easy to fix (as has already been).

for "Many of these individuals distinguish between Judaism and political Zionism…" Again, this is supported by the whole subsection of "Anti-Zionism is not antisemitism", take "Organizations they associate with ... argue that the foundational ideology of Israel leads to the oppression of the people of Palestine" and "Signatories to the 2014 letter ...  object to the characterization of pro-Palestine activism as inherently antisemitic, pointing to their own Jewish identity ..." as examples, all supporting that sentence.

for "Organizations they associate with … argue that the foundational ideology of Israel leads to the oppression of the people of Palestine." I should've clarified the ideology of "self-defense" and criticizing the state = criticizing the Jewish people = calling for another Holocaust .. excepts the source cited "victims of the Nazis who were outraged that Israel used their histories to justify assaults on Palestinians" and "Israel's self-defense is very lopsided. Gazans are a population living in a constant state of siege. They've been driven from their homes, into decades-long refugee camps." = being oppressed. (the sentence is vague more than OR, cuz “what ideology?”)

for "A German-born Jewish-American … known for her work with the International Solidarity Movement in support of the Palestinian cause." I rewrote that from her Wiki page, the lede [[Hedy Epstein]], not OR

For "Their stance is rooted in the belief that lessons from the Holocaust demand opposition to all forms of oppression …” Not sure how is this OR, it's the article itself, multiple cited survivors used their experiences as a base to vocalize support for Palestine and opposition to Israel!!

Currently, 2 editors (R.Rev & Arcticocean) have examined the sources and found no issues. Which was the main problem with my prior LLM mis/use. For the “typical LLM” phrases like ‘rooted in’ and ‘foundational principle’, etc. As a non-native English speaker, these look very standard formal phrases, appropriate for this encyclopedia. Some of these were translations from my native language to English using Google Translate (when I was unsure how to express some info or summaries). It took me serious days to write this article. It’d be seriously unwise of me to write an article related the most debated subject in the past 2 years (on-and-off Wiki), with a warning against me, using LLM, when I expected pushback against the article as there’re editors with strong views for/against the premise. 

Having a “history” of mis/using LLM makes the accusation easy to stick, but I maintain my position that I stopped using it for creating/editing on Wikipedia since the last AE, even prior to the warning. <!-- Template:Unsigned --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Rap no Davinci|Rap no Davinci]] ([[User talk:Rap no Davinci#top|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rap no Davinci|contribs]]) 13:49, 20 January 2026 (UTC)</small>

* '''2nd Reply:''' I didn’t know about that Google Translate update. I will disclose when I use it. For the recommendation about creating WP:CT/A-I articles, I have no objection.

====Statement by Raskolnikov.Rev====
I reviewed the source analysis cited for filing this case and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Holocaust_survivors_and_descendants_supporting_Palestine#c-Raskolnikov.Rev-20260119100800-NicheSports-20260117220800 wholeheartedly disagree with it]. All the content is backed by the cited sources and there's no WP:OR involved or use of GUNREL that I can see. There's some improvements that can be made with attribution, particularly in one case citing a weak source that links to other sources containing the content, but that content was already backed up by other sources added to the body and not at all controversial. In my view it's all rather minor and easily resolvable via regular BRD and editing. Not sure why this was so quickly escalated to AE. [[User:Raskolnikov.Rev|Raskolnikov.Rev]] ([[User talk:Raskolnikov.Rev|talk]]) 10:36, 19 January 2026 (UTC)

The filer responded to my providing a second opinion on the source analysis, as the original editor requested, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Holocaust_survivors_and_descendants_supporting_Palestine#c-Kowal2701-20260119102300-Raskolnikov.Rev-20260119100800 by saying] I shouldn't edit in the topic area either without substantively addressing anything I said. I don't find this helpful and it's not WP:AFG. [[User:Raskolnikov.Rev|Raskolnikov.Rev]] ([[User talk:Raskolnikov.Rev|talk]]) 10:44, 19 January 2026 (UTC)

To briefly respond to NicheSports: As [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Holocaust_survivors_and_descendants_supporting_Palestine#c-Raskolnikov.Rev-20260119112000-NicheSports-20260119110900 I noted on the talk], the example brought up as the supposedly most egregious instance of failing WP:V is actually the worst one to bring up: The [https://web.archive.org/web/20250916182814/https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/30/world/middleeast/30egypt.html cited NYT piece] says the march [[Hedy Epstein]] participated in was organized by [[Gaza Freedom March]], which overlaps with the [[Free Gaza Movement]], which in turn overlaps with the [[International Solidarity Movement]]. Moreover, Hedy Epstein's BLP was linked, which states she was an activist in the ISM in the lede ''citing the same NYT source''. And it should not be removed there either as it is entirely uncontroversial and accurate material given Gaza Freedom March being a part of the broader ISM. [https://archive.freegaza.org/en/newsletterdec09.html Here is a newsletter] from the Free Gaza Movement with a statement from Epstein saying why she joined the Gaza Freedom March and a call to join the ISM at the end, and [https://www.salon.com/2016/05/27/activist_hedy_epstein_palestinian_rights_advocate_and_holocaust_survivor_dies_at_91/ here is the obituary I added] stating Epstein was active in the ISM and Free Gaza Movement. Even if NicheSport's concern that the ISM was not explicitly named in the NYT piece is valid, it could easily be resolved with this addition. This doesn't even warrant a revert, let alone an AE case.

====Statement by NicheSports====
Can an admin independently and thoroughly review my analysis [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Holocaust_survivors_and_descendants_supporting_Palestine&diff=prev&oldid=1333455638] before this case is closed? I believe that both Raskolnikov.Rev and RnD's analyses are unreliable. For evidence of this claim, see the 6th point of my analysis (the simplest, as it documents a black and white [[WP:V]] failure). In RR's talk page response [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Holocaust_survivors_and_descendants_supporting_Palestine&diff=prev&oldid=1333718966] to my analysis, they state that it is "uncontroversial" that the text I highlighted was supported by the sourcing. This is objectively false; the organization "International Solidarity Movement" is never mentioned in the only source [https://web.archive.org/web/20250916182814/https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/30/world/middleeast/30egypt.html]. Meanwhile, RnD stated at the AE thread that {{tqq|I rewrote that from her Wiki page, the lede [[Hedy Epstein]], not OR}}. This reflects an apparent serious misunderstanding of [[WP:V]]; content in articles must be supported by in-line sources, not assertions made in related wikipedia articles. This is the simplest example; I am confident that a reviewing admin will identify other issues, especially related to [[WP:PRIMARY]]. LLM detection is almost always probabilistic in nature (unless someone leaves a chatbot prompt/response). There is a high probability that RnD has repeatedly been dishonest about LLM use: at their talk page [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rap_no_Davinci&diff=prev&oldid=1316249549][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rap_no_Davinci&diff=prev&oldid=1316251584] re [[Draft:Nayda]] and at the prior AE thread [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement&diff=prev&oldid=1322678427]. See this analysis [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement&diff=prev&oldid=1321253631], which mostly explains my thinking re: the prior AE thread. Meanwhile, {{slink|Draft talk:Nayda#High likelihood unreviewed LLM-generated text}} speaks for itself. These probable prior issues make me skeptical of RnD's claims at this AE case to have only used machine assistance for translation purposes while creating the article in question. One more point: it is so much harder to address machine-assisted content in the PIA space because it gets edit warred back in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Holocaust_survivors_and_descendants_supporting_Palestine&diff=prev&oldid=1334093232][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Holocaust_survivors_and_descendants_supporting_Palestine&diff=prev&oldid=1334100694] and people start arguing [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Holocaust_survivors_and_descendants_supporting_Palestine&diff=prev&oldid=1333592169][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Holocaust_survivors_and_descendants_supporting_Palestine&diff=prev&oldid=1333970682] about whether it is anti-semitic (this article isn't, of course - RR, RnD, and I all agree there). [[User:NicheSports|NicheSports]] ([[User talk:NicheSports|talk]]) 23:06, 23 January 2026 (UTC)

:@[[User:Newslinger|Newslinger]] I didn't think that compliance with core content policies was a content issue, but understood on the rest and I am happy to drop this. I will also stop reviewing RnD's edits and will focus on LLM work outside of the PIA space. [[User:NicheSports|NicheSports]] ([[User talk:NicheSports|talk]]) 04:23, 25 January 2026 (UTC)

I think it is fairly clear now that there is no source hallucination within the article, and therefore that RND had checked all LLM-generated assertions. What I think has to be addressed now is the undisclosed use of generative AI to write the prose of the article. The phrasing of the article makes clear, in my view, that it was substantially generated by AI. RND has denied this and says {{xt|the article in question was not generated/created using LLM}}. On a close reading of the article drafted, I have to disbelieve their denial. Many of the usual signs are present, e.g. use of imprecise weasel words ({{!xt|A foundational principle for many is the…}}) and human-impersonating editorialisation ({{!xt|Their stance is rooted in the belief…}}). RND was warned after the last AE report that they may receive a sitewide block in the event of further generative AI misuse. [[WP:LLMDISCLOSE|Failing to disclose LLM use is discouraged]] and [[WP:NEWLLM|writing new articles with them is not permitted]]. I would ask RND to comment on this.

*:Assuming good faith, I am prepared to accept the explanation that this article was not AI-generated, despite appearing to have been. I also agree with Newslinger's recommendation to use AfC in future. As {{hidden ping|Rap no Davinci}}RND has now accepted that recommendation, I think we can treat that as a voluntary measure rather than a sanction, and I would close this enforcement request without formal action, provided no other admins have further concerns. RND, please continue to remember your recent AE warning regarding generative AI use in addition to the advice given in this AE request.

*:The statements (and supplementary comments) being offered in this request are not introducing new or actionable information. As all relevant issues have been addressed and considered, I think this request should now be closed, with 'no action' as the outcome for the reasons I have already given. Unless any uninvolved admins object in the next 48 hours, I will close the request with that as the outcome.

=== Request concerning Glebushko0703 ===

;Sanction or remedy to be enforced:
# [[WP:CT/EE]]
# [[WP:CT/BLP]]

This is the first time I made an AE request. Pardon me for any mistakes. Recently, I came across Glebushko0703 in some articles. I initially did not wish to get involved. However, after a brief encounter with him in relation to [[List of pro-Russian political parties]], I looked at his activity in adjacent articles, noticing issues that caused legitimate concerns.

=== Suspected violations after his recent block ===

==== [[WP:TE]] and [[WP:AOBF]] in [[List of pro-Russian political parties]] ====

Glebushko0703 removed multiple articles from [[List of pro-Russian political parties#See also|See also]] ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_pro-Russian_political_parties&diff=prev&oldid=1334769670 diff1]), claiming {{tq|fixed non neutral "see also"}} without explaining how it was "non-neutral". [[User:MaxPlays|MaxPlays]] reverted him ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_pro-Russian_political_parties&diff=next&oldid=1334769670 diff2]). Glebushko0703 reverted back, alleging {{tq|none of these "see also" have anything to do with most of these parties. clearly pov:push}} ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_pro-Russian_political_parties&diff=next&oldid=1334978284 diff3]) without explaining how it was "clearly pov:push" ''[sic]'', followed by another unexplained revert ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_pro-Russian_political_parties&diff=next&oldid=1335040713 diff4]). 

On the [[Talk:List of pro-Russian political parties#See also|Talk page]], Glebushko0703 insinuated that [[Russian hybrid warfare]], [[Russosphere]], [[Russophilia]], [[Putinism]] and [[Eurasianism]] were "vaguely nationalistic concepts" ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_pro-Russian_political_parties#c-Glebushko0703-20260127050700-See_also diff5]), which is objectively false. [[User:TylerBurden|TylerBurden]] explained how the articles in See also were relevant and [[WP:DUE]]-compliant ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_pro-Russian_political_parties#c-TylerBurden-20260127144400-Glebushko0703-20260127050700 diff6]). Glebushko0703 refused to listen, arguing {{tq|You can't add "LBGTQ" to "see also" of 4 Non Blondes for examples}}, which is [[Wikipedia:Arguments to avoid in deletion discussions#Individual merit|totally irrelevant]], and {{tq|in fact a lot of them just want good relationship with current Russian government to benefit their own country, like german AfD for example.}} without evidence ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_pro-Russian_political_parties#c-Glebushko0703-20260127160600-TylerBurden-20260127144400 diff7]).

Glebushko0703 apparently fails to assume good faith in their inclusion, treating neutral article names as "POV-pushing", nor has he been able to provide any policy basis. The only reasonable explanation for this is [[WP:JUSTDONTLIKEIT]], a problem he exhibits in editing several articles. 

Glebushko0703 refuses to listen to others, alleging that the only reason he is disagreed with is that {{tq|You don't understand my point so you claim it as "bizzare".}} ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_pro-Russian_political_parties#c-Glebushko0703-20260127171200-TylerBurden-20260127165900 diff8]), alongside his bludgeoning ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_pro-Russian_political_parties#c-Glebushko0703-20260128091000-TylerBurden-20260128082300 diff9], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_pro-Russian_political_parties#c-Glebushko0703-20260128104700-Czello-20260128104100 diff10], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_pro-Russian_political_parties#c-Glebushko0703-20260128110400-Czello-20260128105600 diff11]). 

==== [[WP:CIR]] issues in [[Holocaust denial]] ====

Glebushko0703 removed a sourced statement ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Holocaust_denial&diff=prev&oldid=1333884955 diff12]) by claiming {{tq|This entire section is in fact bullsh*t, the book was published by a British publisher}} without explaining how the "British publisher" affects the statement's validity. The statement is sourced to a book of [[ABC-CLIO]] which is an American publisher. [[User:Sumanuil|Sumanuil]] reverted him, explaining {{tq|[[Jürgen Graf|Graf]]'s book wasn't.}} ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Holocaust_denial&diff=next&oldid=1333884955 diff13])

Glebushko0703 reverted within an hour, claiming {{tq|Manual Revert. Please read open the source. Bloomsbury Academic is an English publisher. There's no source to support the claim that the book was published in Russia, let alone that holocauts denial is "freely available".}} ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Holocaust_denial&diff=next&oldid=1333886750 diff14]) as if English publishers are unreliable. 

Sumanuil reverted him, reiterating {{tq|No one is saying that "Holocaust Denial As An International Movement" was published in Russia, because it is about the topic, not an example of it.}} ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Holocaust_denial&diff=next&oldid=1333887413 diff15]) It is clear to the audience that Sumanuil referred to [[Jürgen Graf]]'s book rather than ''Holocaust Denial as an International Movement'', but Glebushko0703 did not listen, nor had he provided any policy basis for his repeated removal.

=== Violations before his recent block ===

==== Edit warring in [[Estonia]], [[Kaja Kallas]] and [[Anti-Russian sentiment]] ====

[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Estonia&date-range-to=2025-12-31&tagfilter=&action=history diff16], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kaja_Kallas&action=history&date-range-to=2025-12-08&tagfilter=&offset=&limit=100  diff17], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Russian+sentiment&date-range-to=2025-12-10&tagfilter=&action=history diff18], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RRArchive502#c-NebY-20251208215500-User:Glebushko0703_reported_by_User:NebY_(Result:_Partially_blocked_2_weeks) diff19]

Particularly, Glebushko0703 edit-warred to insert [[WP:UNDUE|undue]] BLP-violating content into [[Kaja Kallas]] ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kaja_Kallas&diff=prev&oldid=1326217665 diff20], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kaja_Kallas&diff=prev&oldid=1326220331 diff21], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kaja_Kallas&diff=prev&oldid=1326314775 diff22], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kaja_Kallas&diff=prev&oldid=1326347177 diff23], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kaja_Kallas&diff=prev&oldid=1326351209 diff24], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kaja_Kallas&diff=prev&oldid=1326352687 diff25]). Today, Glebushko0703 restored an unexplained AI tag to [[Estonia]] ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Estonia&diff=prev&oldid=1335278481 diff26]) to discredit a proper article.

==== Harassment ====

[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=1318672405 diff27], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:LordCollaboration#c-Ivanvector-20251230014900-Sock_puppet_accusations diff28], to mention but a few.

The user made several comments generalizing those he perceived as Estonians: diff27, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Glebushko0703&diff=prev&oldid=1330460483 diff30], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Glebushko0703&diff=prev&oldid=1330613856 diff31], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kaja_Kallas#c-Glebushko0703-20260110010000-Wilk10-20260109193100 diff32], to mention but a few.

=== Conclusion ===

His conduct is combatively tendentious. Whenever his edits get reverted, he prefers edit warring to force his way through and bludgeoning Talk page discussions to become the last comment in a bid to get his desired "consensus." Such conduct is a net negative to the [[WP:CT/EE|EE]] topic area. The repeated blocks also show a major CIR issue. It is not a constructive use of community time to entertain this. There is a [[WP:PACT|limit]] to assumption of good faith when an unabated pattern of non-neutral editing is seen.

<small>''Statements must be made in separate sections. They may not exceed 500 [[Word count#Software|words]] and 20 diffs, except by permission of a reviewing administrator.<br />Administrators may remove or shorten noncompliant statements. Disruptive contributions may result in blocks.''</small>

==== Statement by Glebushko0703 ====
Most of the diffs are taken out of context and the main argument here seems to be focused on me debating other editors to reach a consensus and "not being right".
This thread reminds me of another [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive1211#Selective RFC application and repeated inaccuracies by Glebushko0703]] and I do not want to waste time on this.

==== Statement by ExRat ====
Glebushko0703 has had a consistent pattern of disruptive editing and has shown, in my opinion, to have a very strong, overt bias against Estonia, Estonians, and Estonian editors, and their edits seem to bear this out. Notable examples of this ongoing behavior, apart from those listed above, include: 

*Following the closing of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style/Baltic_states-related_articles RFC:Manual of Style/Baltic states-related articles] that they created, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GoodDay/Archive_49&diff=prev&oldid=1334272889 Glebushko0703 has threatened to create a Wiki article about a reporter named Ronald Liive] of [[Eesti Rahvusringhääling]] (ERR, Estonian Public Broadcasting, referring to it was "Yellow Press") for [https://news.err.ee/1609903256/estonian-volunteers-struggling-to-protect-wikipedia-from-russian-propaganda reporting on the RFC] for the sole purpose of harassing/irritating Mr. Liive: {{tq|That Mr. Ronald Liive seems like a very active journalist, should we create a Wiki page about him?}} and {{tq|That's why I think he won't oppose the creation of his own article on Wikipedia, but over there he will be listed as born in Estonian SSR unfortunately.}}
*Has proposed to [[User:GoodDay]] that they [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:GoodDay/Archive_49 form a club] called the "Wikipedia Anti-Nationalist Estonian Movement (WANEM)" to allegedly {{tq|counteract socks and POV pushing}} and threating to edit war ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=1330352857 dif1]) [[User:ExRat|ExRat]] ([[User talk:ExRat|talk]]) 22:41, 28 January 2026 (UTC)
