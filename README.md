# WordcountClerkBot

A MediaWiki bot that monitors word-limited statements on Wikipedia arbitration request pages (ARCA, AE, ARC), counts both visible and expanded words, compares them against approved limits, and publishes a color-coded report and data template. It can run continuously or in single-run mode, and is fully configurable via environment variables.

---

## Configuration

The bot is configured via environment variables. All configuration keys use ALL_CAPS naming to match environment variables directly.
